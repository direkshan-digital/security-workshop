# Day 1 - Lab 2 : Log Analytics Customization

DevIntersection Security Workshop

## Exercise 1: Log Analytics Customization

### Task 1: Add custom logs

1. Open the Azure Portal.
2. Browse to the resource group.
3. Select the **wssecuritySUFFIX** log analytics workspace.
4. Select **Advanced Settings**.
5. Select on **Data** then select **Custom logs**.

    > **NOTE** By default, all configuration changes are automatically pushed to all agents. For Linux agents, a configuration file is sent to the Fluentd data collector.

6. Click **Add+** to open the Custom Log Wizard.

### Task 2: Import custom logs

1. Select **Choose File** and browse to the **artifacts/logfile*.txt** sample file.
2. Select **Next**. The Custom Log Wizard will upload the file and list the records that it identifies.
3. On the `Select record delimiter`, select **Timestamp**
4. Select **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS**
5. Select **Next**
6. For the log collection paths, type **C:\logs\/*.log**
7. Select **Next**
8. For the name, type **CustomSecurity_CL**
9. Select **Done**
10. Log in to the **paw-1** virtual machine
11. Copy the logs folder contents to the **c:\logs** folder

### Task 3: Install and Configure MMA Agent

1. On the **paw-1** virtual machine, open the Azure Portal
2. Login using your lab credentials
3. Browse to the log analytics workspace
4. Select **Agents Management**
5. On the windows servers tab, select **Download Windows Agent (64bit)**
6. Execute the **MMASetup-AMD64.exe** installer
7. Select **Next**
8. Select **I Agree**
9. Select **Next**
10. Select the **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)**
11. Select **Next**
12. From the portal, copy the workspace ID and Key
13. Select **Next**
14. Select **Next**
15. Select **Install**
16. Select **Finish**
17. Wait 5-10 minutes for the agent to initialize and start sending event data to the workspace.

### Task 4: Search custom logs #1

1. Switch back to the log analytics workspace
2. Select **logs**
3. In the query text area, type the following:

    ```sql
    Heartbeat | where OSType == 'Windows'| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by SourceComputerId | sort by Computer | render table
    ```

4. You should see the **paw-1** machine displayed. If you do not see it, wait for a few more minutes.  Refresh the query until you see the machine displayed as a result.
5. In the query text area, type the following:

    ```sql
    CustomSecurity_CL
    ```

    > **NOTE** It could take 5-10 minutes before you see custom log data. Azure Monitor will collect new entries from each custom log approximately every 5 minutes.

6. You should see the following results, notice the **RawData** column.

    TODO

7. You can manually break out the information using Kusto functions. Run the following query:

    ```sql
    CustomSecurity_CL
    | extend CSVFields  = split(RawData, ',')
    | extend EventTime  = todatetime(CSVFields[0])
    | extend Code       = tostring(CSVFields[1])
    | extend Status     = tostring(CSVFields[2])
    | extend Message    = tostring(CSVFields[3])
    | summarize count() by Status,Code
    ```

> **NOTE** We would like to expand this out without having to parse it so we'll create Custom Fields in the next task.

### Task 5: Create Custom Fields

1. Run the following query

    ```sql
    CustomSecurity_CL
    ```

2. Expand the first record properties
3. Select the ellipse to the left of the top property of the record, then select **Extract fields from**.
4. The Field Extraction Wizard is opened, and the record you selected is displayed in the Main Example column. The custom field will be defined for those records with the same values in the properties that are selected.

### Task 6: Search custom logs #2

1. Run the following query:

    ```sql
    CustomSecurity_CL
    | where IP_CF == "192.168.102.2"
    ```

2. You should see the following:

TODO

### Task 7: Data Collector API

1. Run the `DataCollector.ps1` script in a PowerShell ISE window, be sure to replace the workspace ID and Key.
2. Run the following query in your log analytics workspace:

    ```output
    TODO
    ```
