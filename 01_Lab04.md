### Task 2: Update and install Azure IoT SDK prerequisites

1. Run the following commands, this could take up to 10 minutes to complete.

    > **Note**:  Depending on your command line tool (cmd.exe, bash, PowerShell, etc.), you may need to run each line one at a time to avoid skipping any commands. You are updating and upgrading as some required packages will requires these updates. You may find it easier to download and run these in a [Putty](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.73-installer.msi) session.

    > **Note**:  The following commands may take 20-30 minutes to complete.

- For Ubuntu 16.04:

```PowerShell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install -y git cmake build-essential curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev

sudo apt-get install libcurl3
sudo apt-get install auditd audispd-plugins

sudo reboot

```

- For Ubuntu 18.04:

```PowerShell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install -y git cmake libcurl4 build-essential curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev

sudo apt-get install libcurl3 libcurl-openssl1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install auditd audispd-plugins

sudo reboot

```

### Task 3: Download and compile the Azure IoT SDK

1. Run the following commands:

> **Note**: You can find the latest release of the Azure IoT SDK [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/releases).  You can open the git to see what the latest release tag is, but the remainder of the lab may not work properly based on a new release.

```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/iotedge --recursive

git clone -b LTS_06_2020_Ref01 https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git --recursive

cd azure-iot-sdk-c

git submodule update --init
```

If you are using a `software-based` simulator (which would most likely be the case with an Azure hosted image and is the default setup for the before the hands-on-lab ARM template), then run the following command:

```PowerShell
cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=ON .
```

Otherwise with a `hardware-based` TPM, run the following:

```PowerShell
cmake -Duse_prov_client:BOOL=ON -Duse_tpm_simulator:BOOL=OFF .
```

Whether software or hardware, setup the new registration and endorsement key tool by running the following:

```PowerShell
cd provisioning_client/tools/tpm_device_provision

make
```

### Task 4: Attempt device enrollment

1. Run the following commands:

```PowerShell
sudo ./tpm_device_provision
```

>**Note**:  This command will fail on a device that does not have a hardware or software TPM installed.  In order to utilize a hardware-based TPM, you would need an actual device with a TPM security chip, or a nested machine with a TPM enabled virtual machine running.  The Azure ARM template provisions an Ubuntu image that does not have a hardware TPM enabled nor does it have a software TPM installed.

![This shows what happens with the device does not have a hardware or software TPM.](media/ex2_image003.png "Failed TPM command")

### Task 5: Install a software TPM and Resource Manager and reattempt Device Enrollment

>**Note**: If you have a hardware TPM in your device, you can skip to step 3.

>**Note**: Devices such as a Raspberry PI do not come with a TPM chip.  You can however add a TPM chip to these devices such as [this Iridium Board](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/details?title=OPTIGA-TPM-SLB-9670-Iridium-Board&source=all-devices-page/).

1. Run the following commands to download, compile and start a software-based TPM server:

    ```PowerShell
    cd

    sudo wget -c https://phoenixnap.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ibmswtpm2/ibmtpm1332.tar.gz

    sudo tar -zxvf ibmtpm1332.tar.gz

    cd ..
    sudo chown -R $USER ~/.

    cd
    cd src
    sudo make

    ./tpm_server &
    ```

    > **Note**: Press Enter to continue entering commands.

    ![Command window showing a running software TPM.](media/ex2_image004.png "A running software TPM")

2. Run the following commands to start a TPM resource manager:

    ```PowerShell
    cd

    sudo apt-get install -y autoconf
    sudo apt-get install -y libtool
    sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config

    sudo wget -c https://astuteinternet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/ibmtpm20tss/ibmtss1470.tar.gz

    sudo tar -zxvf ibmtss1470.tar.gz

    cd ..
    sudo chown -R $USER ~/.

    cd

    sudo autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/local --disable-hwtpm
    make
    make install

    cd local/bin
    ./tsspowerup &
    ./tssstartup &

    ```

    > **Note**: Press Enter after the tss commands to type more commands.

3. With your software TPM running, attempt to provision again using the following commands:

    ```PowerShell
    cd
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c/provisioning_client/tools/tpm_device_provision
    sudo ./tpm_device_provision
    ```

    ![With the software TPM running, a registration Id and endorsement key is generated.](media/ex2_image005.png "A running software TPM")

4. Copy the device **Registration Id** and the **Endorsement Key**.

    >**Note**: In the real world, all your devices should have hardware-based TPMs.

5. Switch to the Azure Portal and navigate to the **wssecuritySUFFIX-prov** Device Provisioning Service.

6. Under **Settings**, select **Manage enrollments**.

7. Select **+Add Individual Enrollment**.

    ![Managed Enrollments and Add individual enrollments are highlighted.](media/ex2_image006.png "Navigating to add an individual device enrollment")

8. For the **Mechanism**, select **TPM**.

9. For the **IoT Hub Device ID**, type **oilwells001**.

10. Enter your Endorsement Key and Registration Id, then select the **True** toggle for the IoT Edge Device setting.

    ![Add Enrollment dialog with the endorsement key and registration id populated.](media/ex2_image010.png "The Add Enrollment dialog")

## Exercise 3: Install and configure IoT Edge

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise you will install the Azure IoT Edge agent on your IoT device and then register the new device with your IoT Hub. Note that you can download Ubuntu iotedge pre-installed virtual machine images in the Azure Marketplace.

### Task 1: Install IoT Edge

1. Switch back to your device SSH window, run the following command:

>**Note**: Change the ubuntu version "os_version" as appropriate (`16.04` vs `18.04`).  You can get your version by running `lsb_release -a`.

```PowerShell
cd

curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/{os_version}/prod.list > ./microsoft-prod.list

sudo cp ./microsoft-prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg

sudo cp ./microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install moby-engine
sudo apt-get install moby-cli

sudo apt-get install iotedge
```

### Task 2: Configure the IoT Edge agent

1. Switch to the Azure Portal, open your **wssecuritySUFFIX-prov** device provisioning resource.

2. In the **Overview** blade, copy the **ID Scope**.

    ![Device provisiong blade with the ID Scope highlighted.](media/ex2_image011.png "Copying the ID Scope")

3. Navigate back to the resource group and open the **wssecuritySUFFIX-iothub** IoT Hub.  

4. Under **Automatic Device Management**, select **IoT Edge**.

5. Select **+Add IoT Edge device**.

    ![IoT Edge and Add an IoT Edge device links are highlighted.](media/ex2_image012.png "Adding an IoT Edge device")

6. For the Device ID, type **oilwells001**.

    ![The Create a device screen with the Device ID filled in.](media/ex2_image013.png "Create a device dialog")

7. Select **Save**.

8. Select the new **oilwells001** item, copy the primary key and primary device connection strings.

    ![The IoT Edge device dialog with the copy link highlited for the the device primary key.](media/ex2_image014.png "Copy the primary device key")

9. Switch back to your SSH shell, run the following command to open a text editor:

    ```PowerShell
    sudo nano /etc/iotedge/config.yaml
    ```

10. There are several ways to register your device with the provisioning service.  This includes manually with a device connection string, TPM registration, and symmetric key.  

    The simplest provisioning method is "manual" with a device connection string.  Each way is presented below, you need **only pick one**.  Note that TPM registration requires a software or hardware TPM:

    >**Note**: YAML file structure formats are very specific.  Be sure that the leading lines have "tabs" that are made up of only 2 space characters.

    - Manual Provisioning

        - Using the device connection string you copied from above, paste it into the config.yaml file.

            ![The configuration file is displayed with the manual settings uncommented.](media/ex2_image008a.png "Configure TPM DPS Settings")

        - Save the file, press **CTRL-X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

    - Symmetric Key Provisioning

        - Comment out the manual provision settings, uncomment the **DPS symmetric key** settings, then copy in the device primary symmetric key and Registration Id information.

        - Save the file, press **CTRL-X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

    - TPM Provisioning

        - Comment out the manual provision settings, uncomment the **dps TPM** settings, then copy in the Id Scope and Registration Id information:

            ![The configuration file is displayed with the DPS TPM settings uncommented.](media/ex2_image008.png "Configure TPM DPS Settings")

        - Although we are using a software TPM, when using a hardware TPM, you would need to give permissions to the hardware TPM to the iotedge service by running the following commands:

        - Save the file, press **CTRL-X**, then **Y**, then **Enter**.

        ```PowerShell
        tpm=$(sudo find /sys -name dev -print | fgrep tpm | sed 's/.\{4\}$//')

        sudo touch /etc/udev/rules.d/tpmaccess.rules
        ```

        - Run the following command to open a text editor:

        ```PowerShell
        sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/tpmaccess.rules
        ```

        - Copy the following into the file:

        ```PowerShell
        # allow iotedge access to tpm0
        KERNEL=="tpm0", SUBSYSTEM=="tpm", GROUP="iotedge", MODE="0660"
        ```

        - Execute the following:

        ```PowerShell
        /bin/udevadm trigger $tpm
        ```

11. After completing **one** of the above methods, run the following commands to restart the iotedge service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart iotedge
    sudo systemctl status iotedge
    ```

12. You should see the iotedge client status as **active (running)**.  Press **Ctrl-C** to exit the status message.

    ![The Azure IoT Edge daemon shows a green active status.](media/ex2_image009.png "Successful service start")

    > **Note**: If you do not see **active (running)**, then run the following command to see diagnostics logs that may help you troubleshoot the issue:

    ```PowerShell
    sudo journalctl -u iotedge
    ```

13. After the above configurations, the IoT Edge modules will be downloaded and created in docker containers. You can review the docker images by running:

    ```PowerShell
    sudo docker ps
    ```

    ![The Azure IoT Edge docker image is shown in an up state.](media/ex3_image010.png "A running docker container")
