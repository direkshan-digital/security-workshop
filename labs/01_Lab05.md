# Day 1 - Lab 6 - Multi-factor Authentication and One Time Passwords (Take home assignment)

Learn how MFA one time token works.

## Task 1: Generate MFA Password

1. Open your [Azure Active Directory portal](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/UserManagement/MultifactorVerification.aspx?BrandContextID=O365)
2. Select your account
3. Select **enable**
4. 
5. Download the git of this workshop
6. Open the `GenerateToken.ps1` PowerShell script
7. Replace the account value with the value you received from the Azure AD Portal
8. Press **F5**, you should see the same value as in your authenticator application

> **NOTE** MFA with Token Generation is really just a second password. If a hacker were to get this second password, they could generate the tokens.
