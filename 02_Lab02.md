## Exercise 5 : Extending Azure Sentinel Incidents (Optional)

This task requires registration to gain access to an API Key. It can take a few days to do this action.

### Task 1 : Api Key

1. Open a browser window to https://api.riskiq.net
2. Select the **Register Now** link
3. Fill out the form, you will receive an email with your api credentials, record these

### Task 2 : Extend Azure Sentinel

1. Open a browser window to https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks/Enrich-SentinelIncident-RiskIQ-IP-Passive-DNS
2. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button
3. Be sure you are logged into your lab account
4. Select your subscription and resource group
5. For the playbook name, ensure **Recent-IP-Passive-DNS** is displayed
6. For your username, type the lab username
7. Select the **I agree..** checkbox
8. Select **Purchase**
9. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Sentinel workspace where you imported the playbook
10. Select **Playbooks** from the Azure Sentinel navigation menu
11. Select the Recent-IP-Passive-DNS playbook by selecting the playbook name
12. Select **Edit** from the top menu of the playbook
13. There are four steps in this playbook requiring you to configure connections
14. Select a Connection from one of the steps requiring configuration and configure a new connection.
15. For the connections to Azure Sentinel the user specified when establishing the connection must have sufficient permissions in the Azure Sentinel workspace to read the security alerts.
16. For the RiskIQ connection, enter your RiskIQ API token and secret obtained from RiskIQ.
17. Select **Save** from the top menu of the playbook to save the playbook
18. Navigate to your Azure Sentinel Analytics page and select an existing analytics rule or template item you wish to add the playbook automation.
19. Select Edit for an existing rule or Create rule for a new rule.

    > **NOTE** The Recent-IP-Passive-DNS playbook works with analytics rules which map IP address entities so make sure you are working with such a rule. For simple testing of the playbook automation you can use rule logic as shown below to force an alert creation with a specific IP address.

    ```output
    AzureActivity
    | take 1
    | extend IPCustomEntity = "144.91.119.160"
    ```

20. Navigate to the Automated response tab and place a check mark in the box for the Recent-IP-Passive-DNS playbook which will enable the playbook to run each time the analytic rule generates security alerts
21. Select **Save** to finish and return to the Analytics page
22. Navigate to your Azure Sentinel Incidents page
23. Locate the incident generated from the analytic rule configured to run the Recent-IP-Passive-DNS playbook automation and select **Full details** from the information pane
24. Select the **Comments** tab to see the enrichment added by the Recent-IP-Passive-DNS playbook automation. You can also view the information in the RiskIQ portal by following the link provided at the bottom of the comment
